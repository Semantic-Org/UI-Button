# Semantic {Component}

## How to Use

This repository contains pre-compiled {component} files using the default themes. This is intended for use in projects that do not need all the bells and whistles of Semantic UI, and want to keep file size to a minimum.

Please consider checking out [all the benefits to theming](http://learnsemantic.com/guide/expert.html) before using these stand-alone releases.
